# Telegram Chat UI with Flutter ğŸ’™

Just tried to build the Telegram chat UI with Flutter. This is just a demo. Attaching the screenshots below.

<div align="center">
<img src="./screenshots/Drawer.png" width=150>
<img src="./screenshots/Chats.png" width=150>
<img src="./screenshots/Chat.png" width=150>
</div>

Nothing else, just UI and thats it.
