# Telegram Chat UI with Flutter 💙

Just tried to build the Telegram chat UI with Flutter. This is just a demo. Attaching the screenshots below.

<div align="center">
<img src="./screenshots/Drawer.png" width=150>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="./screenshots/Chats.png" width=150>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="./screenshots/Chat.png" width=150>
</div>

Nothing else, just UI and thats it.

🚀 The release builds are available [here](https://github.com/HeySreelal/TelegramUI/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

# Thank you 💙
